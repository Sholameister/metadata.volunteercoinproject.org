        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By participating in the Pay It Forward Token (PIF) presale or engaging with the Volunteer Coin Project Foundation (VCPF), you agree to be bound by the terms set forth in this document. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use our services or purchase PIF tokens.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old to participate. You must comply with local laws in your jurisdiction, and you are solely responsible for ensuring participation is lawful where you reside.</p>

        <h2>3. KYC Compliance</h2>
        <p>To maintain fairness and prevent abuse, all presale participants must undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Verified buyers are subject to a 250,000 token cap across early presale tiers. The Foundation reserves the right to deny or reverse transactions deemed suspicious or non-compliant.</p>

        <h2>4. No Guarantees or Financial Advice</h2>
        <p>PIF tokens are not securities. They do not represent shares or ownership in VCPF or any related entity. Nothing provided on our platform should be considered investment advice. Token values may fluctuate, and we make no guarantees of financial return.</p>

        <h2>5. Use of Tokens</h2>
        <p>PIF tokens are intended for redemption through our approved partners and volunteer rewards platform. Use of tokens for illegal or unauthorized purposes is strictly prohibited.</p>

        <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
        <p>See our <a href="https://volunteercoinproject.org/privacy-kyc-disclaimer.html">Privacy Policy</a> for information on how we handle your data.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Any changes will be posted to this page and will be effective immediately upon publication.</p>
